# The C Programming Language

This directory follows along with examples from "The C Programming Language" (this one https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628). I am using this book to learn C, and I am using this repository to keep track of my progress. I am also using this repository to keep track of any notes I take while reading the book.
