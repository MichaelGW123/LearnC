## Introduction

The purpose of this project was to show that I could in fact use GTest with C source code. I have used GTest before but with C++, and assumed that while similar there might be some nuanced differences. Originally I believed that an entirely different testing framework would be required, but after some research I found that GTest could be used with C source code. This saved me from having to learn things such as CMocka, which I had never used before.

## Getting Started

Here are some step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
make -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
